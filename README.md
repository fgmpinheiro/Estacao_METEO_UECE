Description:
This is the code for a weather station based on the ESP32 microcontroller. The station uses various sensors to collect environmental data, including:  
- Temperature: DS18B20 sensor  
- Humidity: DHT11 sensor  
- Atmospheric pressure: BMP180 sensor  
- Wind speed: Anemometer adapted from THIES  

Additionally, the station incorporates a GPS module to provide time reference and geolocation data. The code was developed using the Arduino IDE, and the collected data can be transmitted via the ESP32's USB port or through its Bluetooth interface.
